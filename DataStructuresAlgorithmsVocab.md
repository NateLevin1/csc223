-   primitive vs. non-primitive data structures
    -   primitive = fundamental data types, built into the language - e.g. int
    -   non-primitive = created using primitive data structures. e.g. linked list, stack
-   linear vs. non-linear data structures
    -   linear = elements arranged in a sequential order - e.g. array, linked list
        -   Sequential memory locations or links
    -   non-linear = elements arranged in a non-sequential order. no adjacency. E.g. tree, graph
-   array
    -   Collection of items of the same type.
    -   Fixed size, 0-indexed
    -   Stored in contiguous memory
    -   Insertion/Deletion is slow
-   linked lists
    -   Collection of nodes to form a sequential list. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node.
    -   No need to worry about size
-   stacks
    -   Linear data structure with LIFO
    -   Push, pop, peep (I've typically seen this called `peek`) are operations
    -   `top` variable points to the top of the stack
-   queues
    -   Linear data structure with FIFO
    -   Have to store `front` and `rear` pointers
-   trees
    -   Non-linear data structure - nodes in a hierarchy
    -   One root node. Each node has 0 or more children.
    -   Simplest is binary tree, where each node has at most 2 children (left and right).
    -   Provides quick search, insertion, deletion
    -   Complex deletion algorithm
-   graphs
    -   Non-linear data structure
    -   Collection of vertices and edges that connect the vertices
    -   Generalized version of a tree w/o parent relationship
    -   E.g. node = city, roads = edges
    -   No root node
-   traversing
    -   Access each data item once
-   searching
-   Find the location of one or more data items matching a constraint
-   inserting / deleting
    -   Inserting = adding a new data item
    -   Deleting = removing an existing data item
-   sorting
    -   rearranging data items into a particular order
-   merging
    -   combining two sorted data items into a single list of data items
